		//data hiding - hiding the data from outside world i.e. outside classes.
		//abstraction - force calling those variables using methods. when we do data hiding we create
		//variable as private. if some other class needs them we need to call them with the help of some
		//methods.
		
		
		//Encapsulation can be described as a mechanism in which we encapsulate our code in such a way
		//that it cannot be randomly accessed by other code outside the class.
